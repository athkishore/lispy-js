# LispyJs

This is a JavaScript translation of [Peter Norvig's Scheme interpreter written in Python](http://norvig.com/lispy.html).

The original work is in just 117 lines of code - it doesn't aim to be a comprehensive implementation of a Scheme interpreter, but to illustrate the basic ideas of parsing the Scheme syntax and evaluating expressions. This simple implementation does not handle errors (and assumes the programmer to be flawless!).

[The JavaScript version](https://github.com/athkishore/lispy-js-core) is slightly longer, at about 160 lines, and covers most of features in lis.py. You can type in Scheme expressions in the terminal below and see Lispy-JS do it's magic!
